7 friends walk into a bar on New Year's Eve.

They decide to celebrate with a challenge: *they have to drink 24 shots in 42 minutes.*
<!-- more -->
The only rules are the following: they are allowed a six-minute break between each round of 6 shots. They'll only drink one shot per minute.

The first and seventh pal managed to drink all of the 24 shots, taking the 6-minute breaks in between.The second and third only managed to drink the last shot of the first round, the first and last shot of the 2nd round, and the last shots of the other two rounds of 6. The fourth guy drank the first and last shots from the 2nd round, and every shot from all other rounds. Lastly, the fifth and sixth fella drank the first shot on each round, as well as the 6th shot on the 2nd round.

Your task is to create a "drinking timeline" for each participant. The minutes spent drinking should be represented as asterisks, and the minutes they were having a break or failed to drink their shot should be blank.
After you do that, print each participant's ‚Äútimeline‚Äù in the right order.

The correct output should make you smile!
(P.S. If it doesn't, it's probably not the correct output.)

Happy new year!!! ü•Ç
