Welcome to my blog!

My name is Antonina Kallinteri and I am a Full-stack web developer and Teaching assistant.
I have experience building end-to-end web applications using NodeJS, ExpressJS, React, and PostgreSQL.

I currently work as a TA at a US-based [online school](https://launchschool.com) where I study & teach software engineering fundamentals... and loving it!

I'm also actively looking for job opportunities that will challenge and expand my technical skillset. I would love to join a company where I can learn alongside other skilled and intelligent developers, contributing to projects in a collaborative environment that values knowledge sharing, innovation, and continuous growth.

Technologies/languages on my "todo" list:

- [ ] 60% Python
- [X] React
- [ ] 20% Flutter
- [X] SQL
