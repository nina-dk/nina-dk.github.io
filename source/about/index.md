Welcome to my blog!

Hi, I’m Antonina Kallinteri — a Full-Stack Web Developer and Teaching Assistant with a passion for creating clean, scalable web applications.

I have hands-on experience building end-to-end solutions using Node.js, Express.js, React, and PostgreSQL.

Currently, I work as a Teaching Assistant at [Launch School](https://launchschool.com), where I teach software engineering fundamentals — and I’m absolutely loving it.

I’m also actively seeking new opportunities that challenge me to grow as a developer. I’m eager to join a team of talented engineers where I can contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate on innovative solutions, and continue learning in an environment that values curiosity, knowledge sharing, and technical excellence.

Technologies/languages on my "todo" list:

- [ ] 60% Python
- [X] React
- [ ] 20% Flutter
- [X] SQL
